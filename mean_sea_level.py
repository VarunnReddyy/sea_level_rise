    The primary objective of this project is to forecast Mean Sea Level (MSL) by leveraging advanced machine learning architectures that provide robust and accurate predictions. The focus is on designing a high-performing Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) model that captures local temporal patterns effectively and developing a hybrid TCN-LSTM model to combine TCN's ability to detect short-term dependencies with LSTM's strength in modeling long-term sequential data. By utilizing a comprehensive approach to data preprocessing, including feature engineering to extract seasonal and cyclic patterns, imputing missing values, and standardizing the data for better model convergence, the project ensures that the input data is optimized for training. Further, through hyperparameter tuning, regularization techniques such as dropout, L2 regularization, and noise injection, and early stopping, the project mitigates overfitting and improves model generalization. This work aims not only to achieve high predictive accuracy but also to provide insights into the temporal dynamics of MSL, aiding in understanding trends and guiding decision-making in climate and environmental policy.

    # Detailed Explanation

    The Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) model is specifically designed to handle sequential data while preserving 
    the temporal ordering of input features. This makes it highly suitable for time-series forecasting tasks such as 
    predicting Mean Sea Levels (MSL). Key features of the TCN implementation include:
        """)

    # Key Features
        st.write("""
    - **Causal Convolutions to Preserve Temporal Order:**
      - TCN employs causal convolutions to ensure that each prediction at a given time step depends only on past data 
        points, preserving the natural temporal order of the sequence. This avoids any information leakage from future data, 
        making the model robust for real-world forecasting scenarios.

    - **Dilation Rates to Capture Long-Term Dependencies:**
      - Dilation rates are introduced in the convolutional layers to expand the receptive field, enabling the model 
        to capture long-term dependencies in the data. This allows TCN to analyze patterns over extended periods 
        without significantly increasing computational complexity, which is particularly beneficial for identifying 
        seasonal and long-term trends in MSL.

    - **Residual Connections for Improved Gradient Flow:**
      - Residual connections are incorporated into the network to address the vanishing gradient problem, ensuring 
        efficient training of deep networks. These connections allow gradients to flow smoothly during backpropagation, 
        leading to faster convergence and better model optimization.
