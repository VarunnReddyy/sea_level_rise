    collapsible_section("What are the primary causes of sea level rise?", """
    The primary causes of sea level rise linked to climate change are the thermal expansion of seawater and the melting of ice from glaciers and polar regions. As global temperatures increase, seawater warms and expands, taking up more space, which contributes significantly to the rising levels observed in oceans worldwide. This phenomenon, known as thermal expansion, accounts for about half of the observed sea level rise in recent decades. Additionally, higher temperatures accelerate the melting of glaciers and ice sheets in polar regions like Greenland and Antarctica. When ice from these land-based sources melts, it flows into the ocean, directly increasing sea levels. This melting is particularly concerning because ice sheets hold vast amounts of water; even small increases in melt rates can lead to considerable changes in sea levels over time. Seasonal changes, particularly in the Arctic, have also shown that ice is melting at an unprecedented rate, affecting habitats and increasing the flow of freshwater into the sea. Rising sea levels have widespread impacts on coastal ecosystems, contributing to shoreline erosion, saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources, and the loss of habitat for marine life. Combined, thermal expansion and ice melt present a complex challenge, as they not only contribute to rising waters but also indicate ongoing changes in Earthâ€™s climate systems. Addressing these root causes is essential to managing and potentially mitigating future sea level rise.
    """)

    collapsible_section("What are the effects of sea level rise?", """
    Sea level rise has a range of significant effects on both natural environments and human communities. Coastal erosion is one of the most visible impacts, as rising waters gradually wear away shorelines, threatening properties and natural habitats. Seawater intrusion is another serious concern, where saltwater encroaches into freshwater aquifers, jeopardizing drinking water supplies and agricultural lands. Habitat loss occurs as rising seas submerge coastal wetlands, mangroves, and estuaries, which serve as critical ecosystems for diverse marine and bird species. This environmental change disrupts ecosystems, leading to declines in biodiversity and impacting food chains.

    For communities near coastlines, rising sea levels can lead to forced relocation and displacement as homes, schools, and businesses are threatened or submerged. This creates significant social challenges, as entire communities may need to move, severing historical ties to land and culture. From an economic standpoint, sea level rise leads to increased costs for adapting infrastructure, such as building seawalls, improving drainage systems, and elevating structures. It also heightens the risk of major damage to roads, bridges, ports, and utilities during extreme weather events. In total, the economic and social burdens of sea level rise are vast, and addressing them requires proactive planning and adaptation to protect vulnerable populations and ecosystems.    """)

    collapsible_section("Why is this analysis important?", """
    This sea level monitoring project is crucial for addressing the increasing risks associated with climate change and rising sea levels. By focusing on accurately predicting sea level rise, the project provides insights that can help communities prepare for and adapt to future coastal changes. The datasetâ€™s attributes, which include specific metrics like the highest and lowest recorded water levels, mean sea levels, and detailed tidal measurements, offer a robust foundation for analyzing trends over time. This information is vital for local and national governments, as it allows for better planning around coastal infrastructure, reducing the potential economic burden of unexpected flooding or erosion. High water levels, for instance, provide critical data for forecasting extreme events, such as storm surges, that pose immediate risks to vulnerable communities. Attributes like MSL and MHHW help pinpoint gradual trends in rising water levels, which is essential for understanding the long-term impact on freshwater supplies, ecosystems, and biodiversity. The project also sheds light on the frequency and severity of low tides, important for maritime navigation and ecosystem health. Predicting sea level rise is not only an environmental issue but also a socio-economic one, as it influences housing, insurance costs, and public safety. Ultimately, the data gathered here supports proactive, data-driven decisions that can help mitigate the impacts of rising seas on society.

    collapsible_section("Handling Missing Values", """
Handling missing values is a critical preprocessing step to ensure that the dataset is both complete and consistent for model training. Missing values often arise due to data collection issues, incomplete records, or external factors, and their presence can lead to errors or biases that negatively impact model performance.


For **numerical features** (e.g., tide metrics like `MHHW (ft)` or `MLLW (ft)`), missing values are imputed using the **mean** of the respective columns. This approach is effective when the data distribution is relatively symmetrical and free from extreme outliers. Using the mean ensures that the imputed value reflects the central tendency of the data, preserving feature scaling and overall dataset integrity.


For **categorical or non-numeric columns** (e.g., `Date`, `Time (GMT)`), missing values are filled with the **most frequent value (mode)** of the column. The mode represents the most common category or value, ensuring that the imputation process aligns with the majority of the data. For example, if most records for `Time (GMT)` are at midnight (`00:00`), it is reasonable to replace missing time values with this common occurrence.

---

This dual-strategy approach effectively handles missing data in both numerical and non-numerical features, ensuring that:
1. **Statistical integrity** is maintained for numerical data.
2. **Categorical consistency** is preserved for non-numerical data.

By addressing missing values, the dataset becomes fully prepared for subsequent preprocessing steps such as feature scaling, encoding, and model training, reducing the risk of biases or errors from incomplete data.

Feature engineering transforms raw data into meaningful features that can improve model performance and predictive power. It involves creating new features, extracting useful information, and restructuring the dataset to make it more suitable for machine learning models. Hereâ€™s how feature engineering was applied:

**Temporal features**, such as `Date` and `Time (GMT)`, were transformed to capture cyclical patterns and provide more meaningful representations:

1. **Extracting Components**:
   - From `Date`: Components like **Month** and **Day** were extracted to account for seasonal trends and monthly variations in tidal levels.
   - From `Time (GMT)`: The **hour of the day** was extracted to capture daily periodicity, as tides often follow predictable diurnal cycles.

2. **Cyclical Encoding**:
   - Features like `Time (GMT)` were encoded into cyclical features using sine and cosine transformations:
     - `Sin_Hour = sin(2Ï€ * Time / 24)`
     - `Cos_Hour = cos(2Ï€ * Time / 24)`
   - This transformation ensures that the time representation is cyclic (e.g., 23:00 is closer to 00:00 than to 12:00), which is critical for distance-based models like k-NN or neural networks.

    collapsible_section("Feature Scaling", """
Feature scaling ensures that numerical features are on a similar scale, which is especially important for machine learning models sensitive to feature magnitudes.

**Standardization**
1. Numerical features (e.g., tide metrics like `MHHW (ft)` and `MLLW (ft)`) were standardized using **z-score normalization**. This technique adjusts the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, ensuring uniform scaling across all numerical variables.

2. Standardization was particularly applied for models such as:
   - **Distance-based models (k-NN)**: Ensures features contribute equally to distance calculations.
   - **Neural networks (LSTM)**: Prevents gradients from being dominated by features with larger magnitudes.

By applying feature scaling, the dataset becomes well-prepared for model training, avoiding potential biases and ensuring effective feature representation for models sensitive to scale.

Splitting the data is a critical step in the machine learning workflow to evaluate model performance and ensure generalizability to unseen data.

**Train-Test Split**
1. Divided the dataset into **training** and **testing** sets, typically using an 80-20 split.
2. Ensured that no data leakage occurred between the training and testing phases, maintaining the integrity of the evaluation process.

**Validation Data**
1. For some models (e.g., **LSTM**), a portion of the training data was further set aside as a **validation set**. This was used for:
   - **Early stopping**: To prevent overfitting by monitoring model performance during training.
   - **Hyperparameter tuning**: To optimize the model parameters effectively.

By carefully splitting the data, the model evaluation process remains robust, allowing for accurate performance assessment while minimizing the risk of overfitting or data contamination.

The distribution is unimodal, with a peak around 0 ft, indicating that most of the MLLW values are concentrated near this central value. The density decreases symmetrically on either side of the peak, suggesting a relatively normal distribution with a slight right skew. This implies that higher MLLW values are slightly more common than lower ones, but extreme values in either direction are rare. The KDE plot provides valuable insights into the central tendency and spread of MLLW, helping to identify its variability and role as a feature in predictive models.

    #     st.write("""
    #     Through our analysis and predictions, we uncovered several important insights about sea levels and tidal behavior:
        
    #     1. **Sea Levels Are Rising**:
    #        - Over the past few decades, global sea levels have been steadily increasing. This is caused by factors like melting glaciers, polar ice caps, and the expansion of seawater as it warms.
    #        - The data shows a clear upward trend, highlighting the urgent need for action to mitigate these changes and adapt to their impacts.

    #     2. **Tides Vary Seasonally**:
    #        - Tidal patterns are not uniform; they change depending on the time of year and location.
    #        - Some months experience unusually high or low tides, which can affect everything from coastal ecosystems to shipping and fishing activities.

    #     3. **Extreme Water Levels Are Becoming More Common**:
    #        - Higher-than-normal tides, often referred to as "king tides," are happening more frequently in many areas. These events pose a serious threat to coastal communities.

    #     4. **Accurate Predictions Are Possible**:
    #        - Using advanced methods, we successfully predicted both the highest tidal levels and long-term average sea levels. 
    #        - These predictions provide valuable tools for planning and risk management in vulnerable areas.

        The information weâ€™ve gathered is not just dataâ€”itâ€™s a call to action. Hereâ€™s why it matters:

        1. **Protecting Coastal Communities**:
           - Rising sea levels and extreme tides put millions of people at risk. Flooding can destroy homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure.
           - Our predictions can help communities prepare for these events, reducing damage and saving lives.

        2. **Preserving Natural Ecosystems**:
           - Wetlands, mangroves, and other coastal ecosystems are vital for biodiversity, water purification, and protecting against storm surges.
           - Understanding sea level trends can help in preserving these habitats for future generations.

        3. **Improving Infrastructure Planning**:
           - Cities and towns near coastlines need to adapt. Building seawalls, elevating roads, and improving drainage systems are just a few ways our findings can guide smarter investments.

        4. **Raising Awareness**:
           - By showing clear evidence of sea level rise, we can help raise awareness about climate change and inspire meaningful action at both the individual and policy levels.
