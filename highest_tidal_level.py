The Random Forest Regressor emerged as the best-performing model among the implemented approaches, striking a fine balance between accuracy and interpretability. With its ensemble learning methodology, the Random Forest successfully addressed overfitting issues common in single Decision Trees, delivering a low Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0336 and an R² score of 0.871. Its ability to average predictions across multiple trees enabled it to model complex relationships effectively while maintaining robustness in performance. Additionally, the feature importance analysis provided by the Random Forest offered valuable insights, identifying MHHW (Mean Higher High Water) and temporal features like Month as the most critical predictors for the highest tidal levels. This interpretability, combined with strong predictive accuracy, makes the Random Forest an excellent choice for applications requiring reliable predictions and insights into feature contributions.

The Hybrid Prophet + XGBoost model showcased superior accuracy in handling datasets with sequential dependencies and nonlinear relationships, leveraging the strengths of both time series forecasting and machine learning. While Prophet captured long-term trends and seasonality inherent in tidal data, XGBoost complemented this by modeling residual errors, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional time series models. With an MSE of 0.0296 and an R² score of 0.857, the hybrid model demonstrated its ability to integrate temporal dynamics with nonlinear patterns. However, this approach requires careful tuning of both components and additional computational resources, making it more suitable for scenarios where accuracy is paramount, and computational costs are not a constraint. On the other hand, the LSTM neural network excelled in capturing time-dependent patterns with its ability to model sequential data effectively. However, it required substantial preprocessing, computational power, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve its competitive performance. While each model has its strengths and limitations, selecting the most appropriate approach depends on the dataset characteristics, available resources, and the specific requirements of the task at hand.""")
